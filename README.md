# MiniMax Chess Engine - [Project Board](https://github.com/users/achen4824/projects/1)

A side project which was creating a AI for a turn based game *(chess)* using the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) principles. This project was inspired by **Code Bullet** in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZfv0YgLJ2Q). No code was reused as it's more fun to write it your self. Several improvements over Code Bullet's AI include: 
* Avoiding Checkmate
* Illegally Taking the King
* Moving Pinned Pieces
* Moving into Check
* Ability to take Pieces attacking King
* Moving other pieces while in Check

## Issues
* **Javascript Object Duplication** - [#1](/../../issues/1)
* **Taking the King and continuing the game** - [#2](/../../issues/2)
* **Infinite Loops** - [#3](/../../issues/3)
* **All of the improvements over [Code Bullet's]() AI were once issues.**
